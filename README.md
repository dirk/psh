# psh

psh, the programmer's shell, aims to be a simple, modern command shell. Shells tend to be designed for super-power-users (aka. system administrators). psh, on the other hand, is designed for programmers. A basic familiarity with C, Perl, and similar languages should make one feel immediately comfortable with psh.
